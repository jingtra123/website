## ðŸ“‹ GitHub Repository Setup

Follow these steps to make your repository open source:

### 1. Create/Update Repository on GitHub

- [ ] Create a new repository at https://github.com/philaconvalley/website
- [ ] Or update existing repository settings

### 2. Configure Repository Settings

Go to **Settings** in your GitHub repository:

#### General

#### Manage Access

### 3. Push Your Code

If you haven't already pushed to GitHub:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/philaconvalley/website.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Set Up Community Health Files

GitHub will automatically detect these files:
- [ ] Verify LICENSE shows up in repository

### 5. Configure GitHub Features

#### Labels
Create labels for issues (Settings > Labels):

- [ ] `accessibility` (pink) - Accessibility improvements

#### Security
- [ ] Add SECURITY.md with security policy (optional)
- [ ] Enable Dependabot alerts (Settings > Security)
- [ ] Enable Dependabot security updates

### 6. Add GitHub Actions (Optional)

Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for automated testing:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

```
