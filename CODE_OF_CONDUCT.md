## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these guidelines in determining consequences:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time.

## Addressing Mistakes

We understand that people make mistakes and say things they don't mean, especially in the heat of discussion. If you've done something that violates this Code of Conduct:

1. **Acknowledge** the impact of your words or actions
2. **Apologize** sincerely
3. **Learn** from the experience
4. **Do better** going forward

The community welcomes people who want to learn and grow. Mistakes are opportunities to improve ourselves and our community.

## Creating an Inclusive Space

### Be Mindful of Language

- Use people's preferred pronouns
- Don't make assumptions about gender, sexuality, or identity
- Avoid unnecessarily gendered language ("you guys" → "everyone," "y'all")
- Be thoughtful about idioms that might not translate across cultures
- Ask if you're unsure – "How do you pronounce your name?" is better than mispronouncing

### Center Marginalized Voices

- Give space for others to speak (don't dominate conversations)
- Amplify what others say rather than repeating their ideas as your own
- Recognize that people from marginalized groups may have expertise you don't
- Don't expect people to educate you – do your own research
- Trust people's lived experiences, even if they're different from yours

### Be Welcoming to Beginners

- Remember that everyone started somewhere
- Don't use jargon without explanation
- Celebrate questions and learning
- Never use "just," "simply," or "obviously" – what's obvious to you might not be to others
- Encourage and support people learning new skills
