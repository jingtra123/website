## Tech Stack

This website is built with modern, performant, and volunteer-friendly technologies:

- **[Alpine.js 3.x](https://alpinejs.dev)**: Lightweight JavaScript for interactivity
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)**: Type-safe development
- **[Vercel](https://vercel.com)**: Deployment and hosting (auto-deploy on push)

### Why This Stack?

- **Fast**: Astro ships minimal JavaScript, making pages load instantly
- **Modern**: Tailwind provides beautiful, responsive design out of the box
- **Volunteer-Friendly**: Easy to learn and contribute, even for beginners
