          <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed">
            PhilaCon Valley was born from a simple truth: Philadelphia has incredible tech talent,
            but too many of us – Black, Brown, LGBTQIA+, and underrepresented folks – face
            barriers to breaking into and thriving in tech.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg">
            Founded by Waskar Paulino, PhilaCon Valley started as a vision to create a different
            kind of tech community. Not another networking event where you hand out business cards
            and leave. Not another conference where you sit and listen. A real community where
            we learn together, build together, and lift each other up.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg">
            We meet at Pennovation Works and other spaces around Philadelphia for hands-on
            collaboration sessions. No lectures. No passive learning. Just us, building real
            projects, pair programming, sharing knowledge, and supporting each other's growth.

          PhilaCon Valley centers Black, Brown, LGBTQIA+, and underrepresented folks in tech.
          We know that tech isn't always welcoming to us. We know the barriers, the
          microaggressions, the imposter syndrome.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
          This space exists for us to learn, grow, and build together without having to code
          switch, without having to prove ourselves, without having to be "the only one in the
          room." Here, we're not the only ones. We're the majority. And we're building the
          tech industry we want to see.
        </p>

          Everyone is welcome at our events, but our focus and resources center those who have

        <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Philadelphia has always been a city of innovation, from Benjamin Franklin to The Fresh
          Prince. But when people talk about tech hubs, they talk about Silicon Valley, New York,
          Austin. Not Philly.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
          We're changing that. Philadelphia has the talent, the diversity, the creativity, and
          the grit to be a major tech hub. What we've lacked is the infrastructure and
          community to support homegrown tech talent – especially talent from communities
          that have been historically locked out.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600">
          PhilaCon Valley is building that infrastructure. We're proving that you don't need
          to move to San Francisco to work in tech. You can build a tech career right here in
          Philadelphia, surrounded by people who look like you, support you, and believe in you.
